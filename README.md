# What is this?
Probably the cheapest solution for an ambient-light out there. Currently it needs an wired connection. The ESP8266 is also able to connect over wifi, so i will add TCP-support later.

# What you need

# Hardware
- ESP8266 (e.g. https://www.amazon.de/AZDelivery-NodeMCU-ESP8266-ESP-12E-Development/dp/B06Y1ZPNMS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1510433168&sr=8-3&keywords=esp8266)

- Neopixel Adafruit compatible LED-Strip (e.g. https://www.adafruit.com/product/1138)

- A Breadboard and some cables (e.g. https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-Electronic-Breadboard-Kondensator-Potentiometer/dp/B01J79YG8G/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1510433420&sr=8-5&keywords=breadboard)

# Software
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)


# How to use
1. Flash the ESP8266 through the Arduino IDE - Use the .io-File at ESP8266/sketch.io
2. Start the Windows-Application
3. Enjoy
